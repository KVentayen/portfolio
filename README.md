This was a comprehensive experience to enable the usage of developing autonomous oceanographic data aquisition systems in an embedded systems environment. These systems to used in a device known as the Coastal Profiling Float. With my experince I learned how to apply programming methodologies to develop robust code for the Costal Profiling Float to further the development of this technology at MBARI.
